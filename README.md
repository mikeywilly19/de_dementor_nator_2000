# de_dementor_nator_2000

This Repo contains code and production files for the De-Dementor-Nator-2000.

## Introduction

The De-Dementornator 2000 is an interactive decoration, meant to mimic the famous “Patronus” spell scene from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of AzkabanTM. It works as a connected system involving a fog machine, LED lighting array, and audio emitter, all triggered by an infrared sensor. The De-Dementornator was created as a semester-long project in ECEN 446 - Power Electronics. 

## Summary of files
